### First Look at React

1. **Why Do Front-End Frameworks Exist?**

JavaScript front-end frameworks exist because keeping a user interface in sync with data is challenging and requires a lot of work. These frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue, alleviate this burden from developers by managing the complexity of state and UI synchronization.

2. **React vs. Vanilla JavaScript**

- **React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.**
  - **Component-Based:** Components are the building blocks of a user interface in React.
  - **Declarative:** React uses a declarative approach, making code more predictable and easier to debug.
  - **State-Driven:** React renders components on a webpage UI based on their current state, and it keeps the UI in sync with state changes by re-rendering (reacting) as the state updates.
  - **Extremely Popular:** React is widely used and has a large community, providing extensive resources and support.
